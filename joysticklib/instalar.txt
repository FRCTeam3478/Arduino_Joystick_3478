Copy the Joystick folder to the Arduino libraries folder. Once the folder has been copied, the Joystick library should appear in the Arduino IDE list of libraries. The examples should also appear in the examples menu in the Arduino IDE.

Microsoft Windows
On Microsoft Windows machines, this is typically %userprofile%\Documents\Arduino\libraries. The deploy.bat file can be executed to install the Joystick folder on Microsoft Windows machines (assuming a default Arduino installation).

Linux
On Linux machines, this is typically $HOME/Arduino/libraries. The deploy.sh file can be executed to install the Joystick folder on Linux machines (assuming a default Arduino installation). [Thanks to @Nihlus (Jarl Gullberg) for his help with this.]
